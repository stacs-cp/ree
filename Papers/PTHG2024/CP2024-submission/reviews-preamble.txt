Dear [*FIRST-NAME*],

Thank you for your submission to CP 2024. The CP 2024 rebuttal period
begins now and runs to 2024-06-02, end of day, anywhere on Earth.

During this time, you will have access to the current state of your
reviews and have the opportunity to submit a response.

Please keep in mind the following during this process:

* The response must focus on any factual errors in the reviews and
any questions posed by the reviewers. It must not provide new
research results or reformulate the presentation. Try to be as
concise and to the point as possible.

* The rebuttal period is an opportunity to react to the reviews, but
not a requirement to do so. Thus, if you feel the reviews are
accurate and the reviewers have not asked any questions, then you do
not have to respond.

* The reviews are as submitted by the PC members, without any
coordination between them. Thus, there may be inconsistencies.
Furthermore, these are not the final versions of the reviews. The
reviews can later be updated to take into account discussions
within the program committee, and we may find it necessary to
solicit other outside reviews after the rebuttal period.

* The program committee will read your responses carefully and take
this information into account during the discussions. On the other
hand, the program committee will not directly respond to your
responses.

* Your response will be seen by all PC members who have access to the
discussion of your paper, so please try to be polite and constructive.

The reviews on your paper are attached to this letter. To submit your
response you should log on the EasyChair Web page for CP 2024 and
select your submission on the menu.

Nearly all papers have three reviews at this point, but a rare
few may only have two. We are trying our best to chase up the few
missing reviews and hope to have them very soon.


Best wishes, and thank you again for submitting to CP 2024,


The CP 2024 Chairs.
