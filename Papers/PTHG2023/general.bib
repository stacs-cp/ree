@article{Hertz1990,
  abstract = {We have developed a method for identifying consensus patterns in a set of unaligned DNA sequences known to bind a common protein or to have some other common biochemical function. The method is based on a matrix representation of binding site patterns. Each row of the matrix represents one of the four possible bases, each column represents one of the positions of the binding site and each element is determined by the frequency the indicated base occurs at the indicated position. The goal of the method is to find the most significant matrix--i.e. the one with the lowest probability of occurring by chance--out of all the matrices that can be formed from the set of related sequences. The reliability of the method improves with the number of sequences, while the time required increases only linearly with the number of sequences. To test this method, we analysed 11 DNA sequences containing promoters regulated by the Escherichia coli LexA protein. The matrices we found were consistent with the known consensus sequence, and could distinguish the generally accepted LexA binding sites from other DNA sequences.},

  abstract = {We propose a non-clausal decision procedure for classical
propositional
logic. It is a generalization of the Davis-Putnam procedure and deals with
formulae which are not necessarily in clausal form. Since there is no need to
translate the investigated formula into normal form, we avoid increasing its
size but preserve its structure. This will in general lead
to a much smaller search space and thus to a more efficient method.
We introduce a short \{$\backslash$sf Prolog\} implementation of our procedure showing that
it is possible to implement a non-clausal decision procedure in a compact and
adaptable way. To demonstrate the good performance of the non-clausal approach
some experimental results are provided. To this end we compare the non-clausal
implementation with a clausal-based Davis-Putnam prover using the standard
translation into clausal form as well as the definitional translation.},

  abstract = {Whole-genome mRNA quantitation can be used to identify the genes that are most responsive to environmental or genotypic change. By searching for mutually similar DNA elements among the upstream non-coding DNA sequences of these genes, we can identify candidate regulatory motifs and corresponding candidate sets of coregulated genes. We have tested this strategy by applying it to three extensively studied regulatory systems in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: galactose response, heat shock, and mating type. Galactose-response data yielded the known binding site of Gal4, and six of nine genes known to be induced by galactose. Heat shock data yielded the cell-cycle activation motif, which is known to mediate cell-cycle dependent activation, and a set of genes coding for all four nucleosomal proteins. Mating type and a data yielded all of the four relevant DNA motifs and most of the known a- and -specific genes.},

solving constraint problems: it allows to propagate
constraints of the problem, learning from failure and from the
solver (thanks to recording explanations) and finally allows
to get rid of backtrack-based complete searches by allowing
more free moves in the search space (while remaining
complete). This paper presents the PaLM system, an
implementation of an explanation-based constraint programming

@article{Pavesi2004,
  abstract = {The recent interest sparked due to the discovery of a variety of functions for non-coding RNA molecules has highlighted the need for suitable tools for the analysis and the comparison of RNA sequences. Many trans-acting non-coding RNA genes and cis-acting RNA regulatory elements present motifs, conserved both in structure and sequence, that can be hardly detected by primary sequence analysis alone. We present an algorithm that takes as input a set of unaligned RNA sequences expected to share a common motif, and outputs the regions that are most conserved throughout the sequences, according to a similarity measure that takes into account both the sequence of the regions and the secondary structure they can form according to base-pairing and thermodynamic rules. Only a single parameter is needed as input, which denotes the number of distinct hairpins the motif has to contain. No further constraints on the size, number and position of the single elements comprising the motif are required. The algorithm can be split into two parts: first, it extracts from each input sequence a set of candidate regions whose predicted optimal secondary structure contains the number of hairpins given as input. Then, the regions selected are compared with each other to find the groups of most similar ones, formed by a region taken from each sequence. To avoid exhaustive enumeration of the search space and to reduce the execution time, a greedy heuristic is introduced for this task. We present different experiments, which show that the algorithm is capable of characterizing and discovering known regulatory motifs in mRNA like the iron responsive element (IRE) and selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) stem-loop structures. We also show how it can be applied to corrupted datasets in which a motif does not appear in all the input sequences, as well as to the discovery of more complex motifs in the non-coding RNA.},

  abstract = {Many and diverse combinatorial problems have been solved successfully using finite-domain constraint programming. However, to apply constraint programming to a particular domain, the problem must first be modelled as a constraint satisfaction or optimisation problem. Since constraints provide a rich language, typically many alternative models exist. Formulating a good model therefore requires a great deal of expertise. This paper describes CONJURE, a system that refines a specification of a problem in the abstract constraint specification language ESSENCE into a set of alternative constraint models. Refinement is compositional: alternative constraint models are generated by composing refinements of the components of the specification. Experimental results demonstrate that CONJURE is able to generate a variety of models for practical problems from their ESSENCE specifications.},

@article{Eden2007,
  abstract = {Computational methods for discovery of sequence elements that are enriched in a target set compared with a background set are fundamental in molecular biology research. One example is the discovery of transcription factor binding motifs that are inferred from ChIP\^{a}¬  chip (chromatin immuno-precipitation on a microarray) measurements. Several major challenges in sequence motif discovery still require consideration: (i) the need for a principled approach to partitioning the data into target and background sets; (ii) the lack of rigorous models and of an exact p -value for measuring motif enrichment; (iii) the need for an appropriate framework for accounting for motif multiplicity; (iv) the tendency, in many of the existing methods, to report presumably significant motifs even when applied to randomly generated data. In this paper we present a statistical framework for discovering enriched sequence elements in ranked lists that resolves these four issues. We demonstrate the implementation of this framework in a software application, termed DRIM (discovery of rank imbalanced motifs), which identifies sequence motifs in lists of ranked DNA sequences. We applied DRIM to ChIP\^{a}¬  chip and CpG methylation data and obtained the following results. (i) Identification of 50 novel putative transcription factor (TF) binding sites in yeast ChIP\^{a}¬  chip data. The biological function of some of them was further investigated to gain new insights on transcription regulation networks in yeast. For example, our discoveries enable the elucidation of the network of the TF ARO80. Another finding concerns a systematic TF binding enhancement to sequences containing CA repeats. (ii) Discovery of novel motifs in human cancer CpG methylation data. Remarkably, most of these motifs are similar to DNA sequence elements bound by the Polycomb complex that promotes histone methylation. Our findings thus support a model in which histone methylation and CpG methylation are mechanistically linked. Overall, we demonstrate that the statistical framework embodied in the DRIM software tool is highly effective for identifying regulatory sequence elements in a variety of applications ranging from expression and ChIP\^{a}¬  chip to CpG methylation data. DRIM is publicly available at http://bioinfo.cs.technion.ac.il/drim .},

@article{EssenceOfEssence,
  abstract = {. Essence is a formal language for specifying combinatorial problems, in a manner similar to natural rigorous specifications that use a mixture of natural language and discrete mathematics. Essence provides a high level of abstraction, much of which is the consequence of the provision of decision variables whose values can be combinatorial objects, such as tuples, sets, multisets, relations, partitions and functions. Essence also allows these combinatorial objects to be nested to arbitrary depth, providing for example sets of partitions, sets of sets of partitions, and so forth. Therefore, a problem that requires finding a complex combinatorial object can be specified directly by using a decision variable whose type is precisely that combinatorial object. 1},

@article{ZincPaper,
  abstract = {Zinc is a new modelling language developed as part of
the G12 project. It has four important characteristics.
First, Zinc allows specification of models using a
natural mathematical-like notation. To do so it
supports overloaded functions and predicates and
automatic coercion and provides arithmetic, finite
domain and set constraints. Second, while Zinc is a
relatively simple and small language, it can be readily
extended to different application areas by means of
powerful language constructs such as user-defined
predicates and functions and constrained types. Third,
Zinc provides sophisticated type and instantiation
checking which allows early detection of errors in
models. Finally, perhaps the main novelty in Zinc is
that it is designed to support a modelling methodology
in which the same conceptual model can be automatically
mapped into different design models, thus allowing
modellers to easily },

@article{Chin2008,
  abstract = {The problem of discovering novel motifs of binding sites is important to the understanding of gene regulatory networks. Motifs are generally represented by matrices (position weight matrix (PWM) or position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) or strings. However, these representations cannot model biological binding sites well because they fail to capture nucleotide interdependence. It has been pointed out by many researchers that the nucleotides of the DNA binding site cannot be treated independently, e.g. the binding sites of zinc finger in proteins. In this paper, a new representation called Scored Position Specific Pattern (SPSP), which is a generalization of the matrix and string representations, is introduced which takes into consideration the dependent occurrences of neighboring nucleotides. Even though the problem of discovering the optimal motif in SPSP representation is proved to be NP-hard, we introduce a heuristic algorithm called SPSP-Finder, which can effectively find optimal motifs in most simulated cases and some real cases for which existing popular motif finding software, such as Weeder, MEME and AlignACE, fail.},

  abstract = {We propose a new distance metric for DNA sequences, which can be defined on
any evolutionary Markov model with infinitesimal generator matrix Q. That is
the new metric can be defined under existing models such as Jukes-Cantor model,
Kimura-2-parameter model, F84 model, GTR model etc. Since our metric does not
depend on the form of the generator matrix Q, it can be defined for very
general models including those with varying nucleotide substitution rates among
lineages. This makes our metric widely applicable. The simulation experiments
carried out shows that the new metric, when defined under classical models such
as the JC, F84 and Kimura-2-parameter models, performs better than these
existing metrics in recovering phylogenetic trees from sequence data. Our
simulation experiments also show that the new metric, under a model that allows
varying nucleotide substitution rates among lineages, performs equally well or
better than its other forms studied.},

@article{Falconer2010,
  abstract = {It is generally assumed that sister chromatids are genetically and functionally identical and that segregation to daughter cells is a random process. However, functional differences between sister chromatids regulate daughter cell fate in yeast and sister chromatid segregation is not random in Escherichia coli. Differentiated sister chromatids, coupled with non-random segregation, have been proposed to regulate cell fate during the development of multicellular organisms. This hypothesis has not been tested because molecular features to reliably distinguish between sister chromatids are not obvious. Here we show that parental 'Watson' and 'Crick' DNA template strands can be identified in sister chromatids of murine metaphase chromosomes using CO-FISH (chromosome orientation fluorescence in situ hybridization) with unidirectional probes specific for centromeric and telomeric repeats. All chromosomes were found to have a uniform orientation with the 5' end of the short arm on the same strand as T-rich major satellite repeats. The invariable orientation of repetitive DNA was used to differentially label sister chromatids and directly study mitotic segregation patterns in different cell types. Whereas sister chromatids appeared to be randomly distributed between daughter cells in cultured lung fibroblasts and embryonic stem cells, significant non-random sister chromatid segregation was observed in a subset of colon crypt epithelial cells, including cells outside positions reported for colon stem cells. Our results establish that DNA template sequences can be used to distinguish sister chromatids and follow their mitotic segregation in vivo.},

@article{Brown2012,
  abstract = {Deep shotgun sequencing and analysis of genomes, transcriptomes, amplified single-cell genomes, and metagenomes has enabled investigation of a wide range of organisms and ecosystems. However, sampling variation in short-read data sets and high sequencing error rates of modern sequencers present many new computational challenges in data interpretation. These challenges have led to the development of new classes of mapping tools and \{$\backslash$em de novo\} assemblers. These algorithms are challenged by the continued improvement in sequencing throughput. We here describe digital normalization, a single-pass computational algorithm that systematizes coverage in shotgun sequencing data sets, thereby decreasing sampling variation, discarding redundant data, and removing the majority of errors. Digital normalization substantially reduces the size of shotgun data sets and decreases the memory and time requirements for \{$\backslash$em de novo\} sequence assembly, all without significantly impacting content of the generated contigs. We apply digital normalization to the assembly of microbial genomic data, amplified single-cell genomic data, and transcriptomic data. Our implementation is freely available for use and modification.},

abstract = "The Maximum Density Still Life Problem (CSPLib prob032) is to find the maximum number of live cells that can fit in an n×n region of an infinite board, so that the board is stable under the rules of Conwayʼs Game of Life. It is considered a very difficult problem and has a raw search space of O(2n2). Previous state of the art methods could only solve up to n=20. We give a powerful reformulation of the problem into one of minimizing “wastage” instead of maximizing the number of live cells. This reformulation allows us to compute very strong upper bounds on the number of live cells, which dramatically reduces the search space. It also gives us significant insights into the nature of the problem. By combining these insights with several powerful techniques: remodeling, lazy clause generation, bounded dynamic programming, relaxations, and custom search, we are able to solve the Maximum Density Still Life Problem for all n. This is possible because the Maximum Density Still Life Problem is in fact well behaved mathematically for sufficiently large n (around n>200) and if such very large instances can be solved, then there exist ways to construct provably optimal solutions for all n from a finite set of base solutions. Thus we show that the Maximum Density Still Life Problem has a closed form solution and does not require exponential time to solve."

abstract="This paper presents open-wbo, a new MaxSAT solver. open-wbo has two main features. First, it is an open-source solver that can be easily modified and extended. Most MaxSAT solvers are not available in open-source, making it hard to extend and improve current MaxSAT algorithms. Second, open-wbo may use any MiniSAT-like solver as the underlying SAT solver. As many other MaxSAT solvers, open-wbo relies on successive calls to a SAT solver. Even though new techniques are proposed for SAT solvers every year, for many MaxSAT solvers it is hard to change the underlying SAT solver. With open-wbo, advances in SAT technology will result in a free improvement in the performance of the solver. In addition, the paper uses open-wbo to evaluate the impact of using different SAT solvers in the performance of MaxSAT algorithms.",

abstract="Symmetry occurs frequently in Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). For instance, in 3-colouring the nodes of a graph, a CSP model that assigns a specific colour to each node has sets of equivalent solutions in which the three colours are permuted. Symmetry in CSPs can cause wasted search, because the search for solutions may repeatedly visit partial assignments symmetric to ones already considered. If a partial assignment does not lead to a solution, neither will any symmetrically equivalent assignment. When searching for all solutions, for every solution found, all the symmetrically equivalent solutions will also be found.",

abstract="We introduce Cardinality Networks, a new CNF encoding of cardinality constraints. It improves upon the previously existing encodings such as the sorting networks of E{\'e}n and S{\"o}rensson (JSAT 2:1--26, 2006) in that it requires much less clauses and auxiliary variables, while arc consistency is still preserved: e.g., for a constraint x                        1\thinspace+\thinspace...\thinspace+\thinspacex                                          n                \thinspace≤\thinspacek, as soon as k variables among the x                                          i                's become true, unit propagation sets all other x                                          i                's to false. Our encoding also still admits incremental strengthening: this constraint for any smaller k is obtained without adding any new clauses, by setting a single variable to false. Here we give precise recursive definitions of the clause sets that are needed and give detailed proofs of the required properties. We demonstrate the practical impact of this new encoding by careful experiments comparing it with previous encodings on real-world instances.",

abstract="We present a general tool for encoding and solving optimization problems. Problems can be modeled using several paradigms and/or languages such as: Prolog, MiniZinc, and GECODE. Other paradigms can be included. Solution search is performed by a hybrid solver that exploits the potentiality of the Constraint Programming environment GECODE and of the Local Search framework EasyLocal++ for Large Neighborhood Search . The user can modify a set of parameters for guiding the hybrid search. In order to test the tool, we show the development phase of hybrid solvers on some benchmark problems. Moreover, we compare these solvers with other approaches, namely a pure Local Search, a pure constraint programming search, and with a state-of-the-art solver for constraint-based Local Search.",
