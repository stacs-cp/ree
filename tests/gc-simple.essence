given n : int
letting vertices be domain int(1..n)
given E : set of set (size 2) of vertices

find connected : bool
find C : set of vertices
such that
  true
  , 1 in C
$  , forAll {u,v} in E . u in C -> v in C
$ much slower due to n*n unification in SR:
$ , forAll e in E . min(e) in C <-> max(e) in C
  , forAll e in E . min(e) in C -> max(e) in C
  , forAll e in E . max(e) in C -> min(e) in C
  , connected = and([ u in C | u : vertices])
minimising |C|
