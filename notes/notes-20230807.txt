Ian's high level view of work for CPAIOR:

1. accept an Emini specification,
2. apply variable introduction, and/or some simple de Morgan style rewrites,
3. test sequences of rewrites against a test set of instances, hopefully at least one sequence works to improve performance.

In PTHG paper we envisaged Monte Carlo tree search to investigate sequences of rewrites.

Adding variables is powerful (as in the Steel Mill paper) because when we add a variable we also add a set of domain values that the variable can take, and this stores information that is updated when values are removed from the domain.
Ian's hypothesis is that this storage of information in the domain of the new variables is why variable introduction allows increasing the power of a proof system (such as resolution versus extended resolution, where the domain of new variables is Boolean and yet is still enough to provably increase the power of the system).

Hypothesis: reordering constraints a priori might (through introduction of variables and variable ordering heuristics) affect performance of a model.
Can constraint ordering be ignored (which would allow normalisation), or is it important?

Related issue is renaming of variables: superficially different, ideally want to identify isomorphism via renaming.

If assuming a canonical constraint ordering makes no difference, we could then work with normalised formulas only.
